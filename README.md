# 🌦️ Weather Forecast App

A dynamic weather application built with **Kotlin** and **Jetpack Compose** that provides real-time weather forecasts based on user location or manual city search. This project was part of my mobile development learning journey and demonstrates how to deliver weather data through a clean, responsive UI using modern Android development tools.

## ✨ Key Features

- ✅ **Location-Based Forecasts** – Automatically detects your location via GPS, or you can manually enter a city name.
- ✅ **Real-Time Weather Updates** – Displays temperature, humidity, wind speed, and weather conditions.
- ✅ **5-Day Forecast** – Get detailed weather outlooks for the upcoming days.
- ✅ **Dynamic UI** – Weather visuals change according to current conditions (sunny, rainy, cloudy, etc.).
- ✅ **Offline Support** – View cached weather data even without an internet connection.
- ✅ **Favorite Cities** – Save and view weather data for your preferred locations.
- ✅ **Custom Units** – Switch between Celsius 🌡️, Fahrenheit 🌡️, and Kelvin 🌡️ as well as m/s or mph for wind speed.
- ✅ **Adaptive Interface** – The UI responds to weather and time of day with dynamic styling.
- ✅ **Weather Alerts** – Set up custom alarms to notify you of important weather events.
